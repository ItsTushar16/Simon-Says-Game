A browser-based Simon Says memory game built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.  
This project was created while learning JavaScript and focuses on understanding core concepts through hands-on practice.

## 📌 About the Project

Simon Says is a classic memory game where the player must repeat an ever-growing sequence of colors in the correct order.  
Each level adds a new color to the sequence, increasing the difficulty as the game progresses.

This project helped me practice:
- JavaScript fundamentals
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling (keyboard & mouse)
- Arrays and sequence comparison
- Basic game state management
